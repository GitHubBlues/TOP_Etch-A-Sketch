# **Etch-A-Sketch** 

This project creates a gridded Etch-A-Sketch pad that changes the color of the gridcells when the mouse hovers on them. There is also built-in functionality for changing the grid-size. 

The main objective of this project was to practice DOM manipulation. However, as the project was implemented from scratch it also provided opprotunities for practicing HTML and CSS.

The game is available at: https://githubblues.github.io/TOP_Etch-A-Sketch/.

This project was executed in the context of "The Odin Project" web-development course. A detailed description of the requirements to be met by the game is found at: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project.
