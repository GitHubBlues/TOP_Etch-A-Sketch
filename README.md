# **Etch-a-sketch**

## ***Brief description***
This project creates a gridded Etch-A-Sketch pad that changes the color of the grid cells when hovering over them with the mouse.  

This is the second project in the basic Javascript module (Foundations path) of The Odin Project web-development course. A detailed description of the requirements to be met in this project is found at: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch.

Live demo available at: https://githubblues.github.io/TOP_Etch-A-Sketch/.

## ***Features***
- Allows for changing the grid-size. 
- Select different colors (black and pixelwise random color)
- Gradient functionality, where the opacity of a cell increases by 10% with each pass, meaning that the final color (violet) is shown after 10 passes

    **Future enhancements**
	- Functionality for exporting the painting
	- Functionality for adding a title to the painting
	- Add color picker, so that any color can be used 
	- Add summer and winter palettes where each pixel gets assigned a random color from a set of 6-8 colors
	- Provide pictures that are placed behind the pad and can be colured by the users 
	- 


## ***Learning objectives***
- Practice DOM manipulation
- Learn Grid in CSS
- Implementing clean code principles (consistent indentation, consistent naming of variables and functions using camel case, keep code lines short, use semicolons)
